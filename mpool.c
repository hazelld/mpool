/* Defining some terminology used throughout the program:
 *
 * blob -> A blob of memory is just the large contiguous block of memory that 
 * has been allocated from the kernel. This occurs when the user initializes 
 * the pool, or reallocs the size. It is equal to block_size * capacity.
 *
 * block -> A block of memory that is within the blob, and is equal in size to 
 * what the user has given (init_mpool() -> @block_size). 
 *

/**
 * struct _block - Linked list holding all the blocks of memory.
 * 
 * @next: Pointer to the next struct _block
 * @addr: Address of the block it points too.
 *
 *
 *	This structure's purpose is to hold the location of a single block within a
 *	blob that has been allocated. When the user alloc's memory, a _block is 
 *	removed from the chain of _blocks, and the address it holds is returned to 
 *	the user. When the user dealloc's an address, it is put inside a currently
 *	empty _block and is added back into the chain.
 *
 *	Note there is a 1:1 ratio between _blocks and the pool's capacity, and this
 *	never changes. These _blocks are malloc'd when the pool is init, and only
 *	freed when free_mpool() is called. Once the _block's memory address is 
 *	given to the user, it is put into the unused_blocks list, until the user
 *	deallocates the space.

 * @unused_block_size_list: Size of the unused block list
 * @block_size: Size of each individual block

 * 	This structure holds all the needed information for the pool to function.
